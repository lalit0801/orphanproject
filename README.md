CHAPTER-1



1.	Problem Definition
Problem statements are widely used by businesses and organizations to execute process improvement projects. The main purpose of the problem statement is to identify and explain the problem. This includes describing the existing environment, where the problem occurs, and what impacts it has on users, finances, and ancillary activities.


1.1	Profile of Problem Assigned
The loss of one or both parents , confronts a child with immense psychological an d social problems as well as reducing a child's chances of starting , continuing , or completing school. As they grow older they are also vulnerable to sexual abuse. These risks and other vulnerabilities are also likely to harm their future livelihoods as well . There are no shortcuts or quick solutions to these problems facing orphans and vulnerable children .
The challenge of the Orphan Children Home was to mobilize resources to facilitate setting up of an orphanage centre to alleviate the prevailing problem of poor care of the orphans and other vulnerable children whose number is so big and is increasing constantly.
 
1.2	INTRODUCTION OF PROJECT



1.2.1	Proposed System-

In today's era people even if they want to help for orphans they dont tend to go to orphanage and do donation personally . So here is a website where Admin of the website who can see all the people who have registered for the website . Also Admin can check their donations. Also, Admin is authorised for removing a user from the database and organizing events ,add children and accept user’s request to adopt an children. User can request to adopt an orphan and user can donate and can see events that are organized by admin through the website.User and admin have a login system to access the website.


1.2.2	Objectives :

The general objective of the proposed project is to provide support to orphans and vulnerable children to live a normal life like other children in the country . In Orphan children home number of Orphan, Semi Orphan and Street Children are found. The objective of this application is to develop a website for orphanage children. The problem of orphan / street children is acute due to urbanization and industrialization. Due to the deaths of HIV/AIDS affected persons, Re-marriage of deserted ,widowed, Unwanted pregnancy of Trafficking
,these orphan and street children are left without care and support. These children are involved in rag picking; pick pocketing and participating criminal activities. Therefore, we envisage mainstreaming these children in the building by providing care, support and protection in our ORPHAN CHILDREN HOME.

Software Requirement Specification

A software requirement specification is a comprehensive description of the intended purpose and environment for software under development.The SRS fully describes what the software will do and how it will be expected to perform. It will illustrate the purpose and complete declaration for the development of system. It will also explain system constraints, interface and interactions with other external applications. This document is primarily intended to be proposed to a customer for its approval and a reference for developing the first version of the system for the development team.
Software requirements specification states the goals and objectives of the software, describing it in the context of the computer based system.



2.1	Problem Statement

3.1 Project Plan
 
Chapter -3
 

A project plan is a document, often presented as a Gantt chart that shows each step to take a project from A to B. It serves as a roadmap that shows the project phases, key activities and their start and end dates, dependencies between tasks, and project milestones.
A project plan:
1.	Clarifies the process and activities that will lead to the project’s outputs and
deliverables

2.	Gives you information that enables you to estimate properly and define a
project’s outputs and scope

3.	Enables you to visualise the entire project and see the interdependencies between tasks
4.	Helps you show who does what task, when and forecast your resource requirements
5.	Provides milestones for tracking project progress (and dates for client approvals)
6.	Enables you to baseline and track your project progress properly
7.	Enables the agreement of the all-important live date
 


3.1	Solution Strategy
SDLC is a process followed for a software project, within a software organization. It consists of a detailed plan describing how to develop, maintain, replace and alter or enhance specific software. The life cycle defines a methodology for improving the quality of software and the overall development process.
The Figure 4.1 is a graphical representation of the various stages of a typical SDLC.








Planning
The initial planning stage of a project is the conceptual stage, before anything is really pinned down. Teams will look at the business question or what's needed, as well as costs and resources and more.
 
Design
In the design phase, some of this abstract stuff starts to get molded into discrete planning through design specification models. Buy-in applies, and cost logistics loom.
Build
Here teams began to generate the code. During the build phase or implementation phase, the actual primary codebase work takes place. This is the kind of fulcrum for everything that came before, design and planning, and everything that comes after, testing, evaluating and maintaining into the production environment.
Test
The testing phase will run the gamut through various different types of testing to see if the software meets the specifications.
Deploy

The deploy phase can be thought of as taking all of that built stuff and making it work for the first time. The prototyping model is relevant here. As the codebase starts to actually do its work, there's a focus toward what comes afterward – primarily testing.
Maintenance and Release

Here, teams may contemplate updates and patches, and start to work with the product as it becomes external-facing.

CHAPTER-4 SYSTEM DESIGN

4.1	 System Design: System design is the process of defining the architecture, modules, interface, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirement. System design could be seen as the application of system theory to product development.
The primary objective of the design is to deliver the requirements as specified in the feasibility report. These are the some of the objectives, which I kept in mind:-
•	Practicality: The system is quite stable and can be operated by the people with average intelligence.
•	Efficiency:	I	tried	to	involve	accuracy,	timeliness	and
comprehensiveness of the system output.
•	Cost: It is desirable to aim for the system with a minimum cost subject to the condition that it must satisfy the entire requirement.
•	Flexibility: I have tried that the system should be modifiable depending
on the changing needs of the user.	Such modifications should entail extensive reconstructing or recreation of software.
•	Security: This is very important aspect which I followed in this
designing phase and tried to covers the areas of hardware reliability, fallback procedures, and physical security of data.

4.2	  DATA FLOW DIAGRAMS (DFD)

It is a way of expressing system requirement in a graphical form; this leads to a modular design. It is also known as bubble chart, has the purpose of clarifying system requirements and identifying major transformations that will become program in system design. So it is the starting point of the design phase that functionally decomposes the requirement specifications down to the lowest level of
 
details. A DFD consist of a series of bubbles joined by lines. The bubbles represent data transformation and the lines represent data flows in the system. There are basically four main symbols used in a DFD, which are depicted below:


i.	Square: It represents source/destination of system data.



ii.	Arrow: It identifies data flow; it is a pipeline through which the data flows.


iii.	Circle/Bubble: It represents a process that transforms incoming data flow into outgoing data flow. A process can be represented by a circle or an oval bubble.
 	 



iv.	Open Rectangle: It represents a data store.

4.3	 ER Diagram

ER diagram
An entity-relationship diagram, or ERD, is a chart that visually represents the relationship between database entities. ERDs model an organization’s data storage requirements with three main components: entities, attributes, and relationships.
Symbols used in ER Diagram
Entities: - An entity is an object with a distinct set of properties that is easily identified.
 
Attributes: - An attribute is a property of an entity that differentiates it from other entities and provides information about the entity.
Relationship: - A relationship is a crucial part of the design of database.which represents the link between different entities.

CHAPTER-5

Implementation and Testing
Implementation is the process of building the web according to its design. A web implementer creates hypertext markup language (HTML), Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programs, and/or Java scripts and/or applets. The implementation process resembles software development because it involves using a specific syntax for encoding web structures or a programming language in a formal language in computer files. Although there are automated tools to help with the construction of HTML documents, a thorough grounding in HTML enriches the web implementor's expertise

Web testing is a software testing practice to test websites or web applications for potential bugs. It's a complete testing of web-based applications before making live. A web-based system needs to be checked completely from end-to-end before it goes live for end users.


5.1	 Python: Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object- oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.
 


Python Features :
•	Easy To Learn And Use
•	Expressive Language
•	Interpreted Language
•	Cross Platform Language
•	Free and Open-Source
•	Object-Oriented Language
•	Extensible
•	Large Standard Library
•	GUI Programming Support
•	Integrated
•	Dynamically Typed
•	Beginner’s Language
•	Portable Language
•	Embeddable
•	Extensible


i)	Easy To Learn and Use

Python is easy to learn and use. It is developer-friendly and high level programming language.
ii)	Easy to code
As we have seen in earlier lessons, Python is very easy to code. Compared to other popular languages like Java and C++, it is easier to code in Python. Anyone can learn python syntax in just a few hours.
 
Though sure, mastering Python requires learning about all its advanced concepts and packages and modules. That takes time. Thus, it is programmer-friendly.
iii)	Easy to read
Being a high-level language, Python code is quite like English. Also, since it is dynamically-typed, it mandates indentation. This aids readability.
iv)	Expressive Language
Python language is more expressive means that it is more understandable and readable.Python provides us with a myriad of constructs that help us focus on the solution rather than on the syntax. This is one of the outstanding python features that tells you why you should learn Python.
v)	Interpreted Language
Python is an interpreted language i.e. interpreter executes the code line by line at a time. This makes debugging easy and thus suitable for beginners. In Python, there is no need to compile the program.
Internally, its source code is converted into an immediate form called bytecode. So, only run the Python code without worrying about linking to libraries, and a few other things. As Python is an interpreted language, This means that, unlike other languages like C and its variants, Python does not need to be compiled before it is run.
 
vi)	Cross-platform Language
Python can run equally on different platforms such as Windows, Linux, Unix and Macintosh etc. So, we can say that Python is a portableable language.
vii)	Free and Open Source
Python language is freely available at official web address.The source- code is also available. Therefore it is open source.Python is open- source. This means that its source code is available to the public. You can download it, change it, use it, and distribute it. This is called FLOSS (Free/Libre and Open Source Software). As Python is freely available, So You can download it from the following link https://www.python.org/downloads/
viii)	Object-Oriented Language

Python supports object oriented language and concepts of classes and objects come into existence.

Object-oriented means we organize our software as a combination of
different types of objects that incorporates both data and behavior.
Object-oriented	programming(OOPs) is a methodology that simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some rules.
Basic concepts of OOPs are:
•	Object
•	Class
•	Inheritance
•	Polymorphism
•	Abstraction
 
•	Encapsulation

i)	Extensible

It implies that other languages such as C/C++ can be used to compile the code and thus it can be used further in our python code.
ii)	Large Standard Library
Python has a large and broad library and provides rich set of module and functions for rapid application development.Python downloads with a large library that you can use so you don’t have to write your own code for every single thing. There are libraries for regular expressions, documentation-generation, unit-testing, web browsers, threading, databases, CGI, email, image manipulation, and a lot of other functionality.
iii)	GUI Programming Support
Graphical user interfaces can be developed using Python.Users can use “Tkinter” and “Turtle” libraries to create basic GUIs.
iv)	Integrated
It can be easily integrated with languages like C, C++, JAVA etc.

v)	Dynamically Typed
Python is dynamically typed, this means that you don’t need to state the types of variables when you declare them or anything like that. You can do things like x=111 and then x="I'm a string" without error.
vi)	Beginner’s Language
Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text
 
processing to WWW browsers to games.


vii)	Portable Language
In python, you can take one code and run it on any machine. There is no need to write different code for different machines. This makes Python a portable language.
viii)	Embeddable
We just saw that we can put code in other languages in our Python source code. However, it is also possible to put our Python code in a source code in a different language like C++. This allows us to integrate scripting capabilities into our program of the other language.

ix)	Extensible
If needed, you can write some of your Python code in other languages like C++. This makes Python an extensible language, meaning that it can be extended to other languages.




5.2	THE WEB AND HTML :

World Wide Web (WWW) programming deals with the development of hypertext document interaction mechanisms, which provide the client with a rich and intuitive interface to the information that he or she desires to view. Web development heavily utilizes the functionality of the Hypertext Markup Language, commonly known as HTML. HTML is a simple scripting language that is interpreted within a web browser. It provides functionality to identify and specify
 

 







how information is presented to the user. Some of the important features of HTML that make it ideal for online representation of information are –
•	Ease of Use – HTML constructs are very easy to comprehend, and can be used effectively by anybody.
•	Machine Independence – The methodology used by HTML to mark up information is independent of its representation on a particular hardware or software architecture.
•	Standardization – HTML syntax is a worldwide standard, developed by the W3C
•	Flexible – HTML has been extended in many forms to provide additional functionality.



5.3	CSS: Cascading Style Sheet
 

 







Basically used for styling purpose. Syntax:




A CSS rule has two main parts: a selector, and one or more declarations: The selector is normally the HTML element you want to style.
Each declaration consists of a property and a value. This page will be save with the extension .css
The property is the style attribute you want to change. Each property has a value.


CSS can be added to your pages at 3 different levels:
 
1.	Internal
2.	External
3.	Inline


5.4	JAVA SCRIPT

Java script is one of the most simple, versatile and effective languages used to extend functionality in websites. Uses range from on screen visual effects to processing and calculating data on web pages with ease as well as extended functionality to websites using third party scripts among several other handy features, however it possesses some negative effects that might make you want to think twice before implementing JavaScript on your website.







s

Advantages

•	Java is executed on the client side: this means that the code is executed on the user's processor instead of the web server thus saving bandwidth and strain on the web server.

•	Java Script is a relatively easy language The JavaScript language is relatively easy to learn and comprises of syntax that is close to English. It uses the
 
DOM model that provides plenty of prewritten functionality to the various objects on pages making it a breeze to develop a script to solve a custom purpose.

•	JavaScript is relatively fast to the end user As the code is executed on the user's computer, results and processing is completed almost instantly depending on the task (tasks in javascript on web pages are usually simple so as to prevent being a memory hog ) as it does not need to be processed in the site's web server and sent back to the user consuming local as well as server bandwidth.

•	Extended functionality to web pages Third party add-ons like Grease monkey enable JavaScript developers to write snippets of JavaScript which can execute on desired web pages to extend its functionality. If you use a website and require a certain feature to be included, you can write it yourself and use an add-on like grease monkey to implement it on the web page.



Disadvantages of JavaScript Security Issues:
JavaScript snippets, once appended onto web pages execute on client servers immediately and therefore can also be used to exploit the user's system. While certain restriction is set by modern web standards on browsers, malicious code can still be executed complying with the restrictions set.
 
5.5	Django :


Django is a Python-based web framework that allows you to quickly create efficient web applications. It is also called batteries included framework because Django provides built-in features for everything including Django Admin Interface, default database – SQLlite3, etc. When you’re building a website, you always need a similar set of components: a way to handle user authentication (signing up, signing in, signing out), a management panel for your website, forms, a way to upload files, etc. Django gives you ready-made components to use and that too for rapid development.





4.5.1	DjangoFramework



 



	Django – Design Philosophies
Django comes with the following design philosophies −
	Loosely Coupled − Django aims to make each element of its stack independent of the others.
	Less Coding − Less code so in turn a quick development.
	Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) − Everything should be developed only in exactly one place instead of repeating it again and again.
	Fast Development − Django's philosophy is to do all it can to facilitate hyper-fast development.
	Clean Design − Django strictly maintains a clean design throughout its own code and makes it easy to follow best web-development practices.

	Advantages of Django
Here are few advantages of using Django which can be listed out here −
•	Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) Support − Django provides a bridge between the data model and the database engine, and supports a large set of database systems including MySQL, Oracle, Postgres, etc. Django also supports NoSQL database through Django-nonrel fork. For now, the only NoSQL databases supported are MongoDB and google app engine.
•	Multilingual Support − Django supports multilingual websites through its built-in internationalization system. So you can develop your website, which would support multiple languages.
•	Framework Support − Django has built-in support for Ajax, RSS, Caching and various other frameworks.
•	Administration GUI − Django provides a nice ready-to-use user interface for administrative activities.
•	Development Environment − Django comes with a lightweight web server to facilitate end-to-end application development and testing.
 

Django - Environment
Django development environment consists of installing and setting up Python, Django, and a Database System. Since Django deals with web application, it's worth mentioning that you would need a web server setup as well.

5.6	SQLite:


SQLite is an open-source database that helps to interact with relational databases. SQLite is stored as a single file. This makes sharing databases easier. By default, Django uses the SQLite database. The settings.py file contains all the project settings along with database connection details. By default, Django works with SQLite, database and allows configuring for other databases as well.SQLite has the following noticeable features: self- contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional.
	Serverless
Normally, an RDBMS such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc., requires a separate server process to operate. The applications that want to access the database server use TCP/IP protocol to send and receive requests.
This is called client/server architecture.
The following diagram illustrates the RDBMS client/server architecture:
 

 

SQLite does NOT work this way.
SQLite does NOT require a server to run.
SQLite database is integrated with the application that accesses the database. The applications interact with the SQLite database read and write directly from the database files stored on disk.
The following diagram illustrates the SQLite server-less architecture:

	Self-Contained
SQLite is self-contained means it requires minimal support from the operating system or external library. This makes SQLite usable in any environment especially in embedded devices like iPhones, Android phones, game consoles, handheld media players, etc.
SQLite is developed using ANSI-C. The source code is available as a big sqlite3.c and its header file sqlite3.h. If you want to develop an application
 
that uses SQLite, you just need to drop these files into your project and compile it with your code.
	Zero-configuration
Because of the serverless architecture, you don’t need to “install” SQLite before using it. There is no server process that needs to be configured, started, and stopped.
In addition, SQLite does not use any configuration files.
	Transactional
All transactions in SQLite are fully ACID-compliant. It means all queries and changes are Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, and Durable.
In other words, all changes within a transaction take place completely or not at all even when an unexpected situation like application crash, power failure, or operating system crash occurs.

	SQLite distinctive features
SQLite uses dynamic types for tables. It means you can store any value in any column, regardless of the data type.
SQLite allows a single database connection to access multiple database files simultaneously. This brings many nice features like joining tables in different databases or copying data between databases in a single command.
SQLite is capable of creating in-memory databases that are very fast to work with.
 
#How to run the project?
Steps:
1.After getting access of file, copy it into your c drive.
2. Go to the file, open command prompt.
3. Type "python manage.py runserver"
4. Go to your local browser and open localhost:8000 server to see final output.
